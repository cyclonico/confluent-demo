Demonstration of Confluent producer and consumer.

The configuration file java.config containing the API keys and secrets is not included in the public repository; it is however needed to run the producers and consumers. The file example.config is included for guidance with the api key information removed.

Brief description:
    - 2 producers getting "facts" each from an API, classifying them as factual or anecdotal; each producer is producing to a separate topic ("catFacts" and "dogFacts")
    - ksql persistent queries filtering the streams from the topics above into a factual stream (cat and dog combined), and feeding a "petFactuals" topic
    - consumer polling the "petFactuals" topic and displaying on the console.

I used Java, Visual Studio Code and Maven for the development.
